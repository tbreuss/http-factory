HTTP-Factory is a PHP package that implements [PSR-17 HTTP factories](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-17/) interface.
It acts as a simple facade to provide easy access to concrete HTTP factory packets.
As its main feature it offers support for auto-discovery of the supported factories.

All PSR-17 interfaces are implemented:

- Psr\Http\Message\ResponseFactoryInterface
- Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestFactoryInterface
- Psr\Http\Message\StreamFactoryInterface
- Psr\Http\Message\UploadedFileFactoryInterface
- Psr\Http\Message\UriFactoryInterface

Additionally, it implements a createServerRequestFromGlobals method, which is not part of PSR-17.

## Auto-discovering PSR-7 packages 

The package features auto-discovery support for the following PSR-7 packages:

1. laminas/laminas-diactoros
2. guzzlehttp/psr7  
3. slim/slim
4. nyholm/psr7

The auto-discovery mechanism assumes that you are using one (and only one) of the above PSR-7 packages in your project.
The first detected PSR-17 package will then be used for all interface factory methods.

## Installation

When starting a new project one of the following PSR-7 packages must be installed.

~~~bash
$ composer require laminas/laminas-diactoros
$ composer require guzzlehttp/psr7
$ composer require slim/slim
$ composer require nyholm/psr7
~~~

When using the "nyholm/psr7" package you have to require the "nyholm/psr7-server" package, too.

~~~bash
$ composer require nyholm/psr7-server
~~~

Then install the HTTP-Factory package.

~~~bash
$ composer require tebe/http-factory
~~~

You can now use HTTP-Factory in the codebase of your project like so:

~~~php
use Tebe\HttpFactory\HttpFactory;

$factory = new HttpFactory();

# creates a ResponseInterface
$factory->createResponse(int $code = 200, string $reasonPhrase = '');

# creates a ServerRequestInterface
$factory->createServerRequest(string $method, $uri, array $serverParams = []);

# creates a ServerRequestInterface
$factory->createServerRequestFromGlobals();

# creates a StreamInterface
$factory->createStream(string $content = '');

# creates a StreamInterface
$factory->createStreamFromFile(string $filename, string $mode = 'r');

# creates a StreamInterface
$factory->createStreamFromResource($resource);

# creates an UriInterface
$factory->createUri(string $uri = '');

# creates an UploadedFileInterface
$factory->createUploadedFile(
    StreamInterface $stream, 
    int $size = null, 
    int $error = \UPLOAD_ERR_OK, 
    string $clientFilename = null, 
    string $clientMediaType = null
); 
~~~

## Usage

### Using constructor

~~~php
use Tebe\HttpFactory\HttpFactory;

$factory = new HttpFactory();
$response = $factory->createResponse(200);
echo $response->getStatusCode();
~~~

### Using static instance method

~~~php
use Tebe\HttpFactory\HttpFactory;

$response = HttpFactory::instance()->createResponse(200);
echo $response->getStatusCode();
~~~

### Using own strategies 

~~~php
use Tebe\HttpFactory\HttpFactory;

HttpFactory::setStrategies([
    DiactorosFactory::class,
    GuzzleFactory::class,
    SlimFactory::class
]);

$response = HttpFactory::instance()->createResponse(200);
echo $response->getStatusCode();
~~~

### Using own factory

~~~php
use Tebe\HttpFactory\HttpFactory;
use Tebe\HttpFactory\FactoryInterface;

class MyFactory implements FactoryInterface
{
    // implement interface methods
}

$factory = new HttpFactory();
$factory->setFactory(new MyFactory());
$response = $factory->createResponse(200);
echo $response->getStatusCode();
~~~
